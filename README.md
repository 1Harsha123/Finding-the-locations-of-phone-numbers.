# Finding-the-locations-of-phone-numbers.
This Python script leverages the phonenumbers library to extract information related to a specified phone number. The script begins by importing necessary modules, including phonenumbers, timezone, geocoder, and carrier.

The user is prompted to input a phone number with the country code.

The script uses the phonenumbers.parse() function to parse the input phone number.

It then utilizes the timezone.time_zones_for_number() function to obtain the time zone(s) associated with the provided phone number.

The carrier.name_for_number() function is employed to retrieve the name of the carrier associated with the provided phone number in English.

The geocoder.description_for_number() function is used to acquire the description of the geographical location associated with the provided phone number in English.

Finally, the script prints the parsed phone number, the associated time zone(s), the carrier name, and the geographical location description to the console.
